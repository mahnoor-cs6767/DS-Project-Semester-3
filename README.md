📌 **Project Title:** Stack Text Editor 

📚 **Course:**  Data Structures 

🎓 **Semester:** 3rd Semester

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project was developed as part of the **Data Structures** course in the third semester. It focuses on building a simple **Text Editor** using the **Stack Data Structure** to implement **Undo** and **Redo** functionalities.

The system allows users to:

- Append new text  
- Undo and redo changes  
- Save and load text from files  
- View current editor content  

---

## 💡 Features  

- ✅ Append new text  
- 🔄 Undo last change  
- 🔁 Redo undone change  
- 💾 Save text to file  
- 📂 Load text from file  
- 👀 View current text  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  

- **Undo Stack** stores previous versions of the text.  
- **Redo Stack** stores undone versions for redoing.  
- Every time you append or load text, the current state is pushed to the undo stack.  
- Undo pops from undo stack and pushes to redo stack.  
- Redo pops from redo stack and pushes to undo stack.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- Language: **C++**  
- Tools: **VS Code**, **Dev C++**  
- Concepts: **Stack**, **File Handling**, **Menu-driven Interface**
